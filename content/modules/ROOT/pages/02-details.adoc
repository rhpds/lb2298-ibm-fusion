* IBM Fusion storage operator installed and configured
* Pre-configured storage classes for VM workloads

=== Environment access

Participants need access to:

* Red Hat OpenShift web console
* OpenShift CLI (`oc`) via bastion host or web terminal
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

=== Network requirements

* Internet connectivity for accessing the OpenShift console
* Access to the lab environment URLs provided in credentials

== Environment setup

=== Pre-configured environment

This lab environment is fully pre-configured. The following components are already installed and ready:

* OpenShift Virtualization operator and HyperConverged custom resource
* IBM Fusion storage classes and persistent volume provisioner
* VM templates for common operating systems
* Migration Toolkit for Virtualization operator (Module 3)
* Sample workloads for migration exercises

=== Setup validation

Run these commands to verify your environment:

[source,bash]
----
# Verify OpenShift CLI access
oc whoami

# Verify cluster version
oc get clusterversion

# Check OpenShift Virtualization operator status
oc get csv -n openshift-cnv | grep kubevirt

# Check IBM Fusion storage classes
oc get storageclass | grep fusion

# Verify VM templates are available
oc get templates -n openshift
----
