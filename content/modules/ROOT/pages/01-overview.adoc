== The virtualization modernization challenge

Many organizations today face a critical decision point with their virtualization infrastructure. Licensing changes, rising costs, and the need for cloud-native agility are driving teams to re-evaluate their approach to running virtual machine workloads.

Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization and IBM Fusion together offer a path forward, enabling you to run VMs alongside containers on a single platform with enterprise-grade storage.

**Your objective**: Gain hands-on experience deploying, managing, and migrating virtual machine workloads using OpenShift Virtualization with IBM Fusion storage integration.

== Success criteria

By the end of this workshop, you will have practical skills in:

* Navigating the OpenShift Virtualization console and understanding the architecture
* Creating and configuring virtual machines using templates and custom specifications
* Leveraging IBM Fusion storage classes for persistent VM storage
* Performing VM lifecycle operations such as live migration, snapshots, and cloning
* Planning and executing workload migrations from legacy virtualization platforms using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization

**Technical outcome**: You will have hands-on experience running VM workloads on OpenShift with enterprise storage provided by IBM Fusion.

== Target audience

This workshop is designed for:

* Infrastructure architects evaluating virtualization modernization strategies
* Site reliability engineers managing hybrid VM and container environments
* Platform engineers building and operating OpenShift-based infrastructure
* Infrastructure engineers responsible for VM workload management

== What you need to succeed

You should have:

* Basic understanding of virtualization concepts (VMs, hypervisors, datastores)
* Familiarity with Red Hat OpenShift navigation (projects, operators, console)
* Comfort using a terminal and command line tools
* No prior OpenShift Virtualization or IBM Fusion experience required

== Why OpenShift Virtualization with IBM Fusion

**Current challenges** facing virtualization teams:

* **Licensing uncertainty**: Changing vendor strategies create cost and continuity risks
* **Siloed infrastructure**: VMs and containers managed on separate platforms increase operational overhead
* **Storage complexity**: VM workloads require enterprise-grade persistent storage with data protection
* **Migration risk**: Moving workloads between platforms involves downtime and validation effort

**How this workshop addresses them**:

* **Unified platform**: Run VMs and containers side by side on OpenShift, managed with familiar Kubernetes tooling
* **Enterprise storage**: IBM Fusion provides persistent, performant storage with snapshot and replication capabilities
* **Simplified migration**: The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization automates workload migration from legacy platforms
* **Operational consistency**: A single management plane for all workloads reduces complexity and training overhead

== Workshop modules

**Module 1: Exploring the environment** (~30 minutes)

Tour the OpenShift console, OpenShift Virtualization operator, and IBM Fusion storage integration. Create your first VM from a template.

**Module 2: VM lifecycle management** (~30 minutes)

Configure VMs with custom resources, work with IBM Fusion-backed storage, and perform live migration, snapshots, and cloning.

**Module 3: Workload migration** (~30 minutes)

Use the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization to plan and execute a migration from a legacy virtualization platform.

== Common questions

**"Can we run our existing VM workloads without changes?"**

Yes. OpenShift Virtualization runs standard VM images. Module 1 demonstrates creating VMs from existing templates and images.

**"What about storage performance for VM workloads?"**

IBM Fusion provides enterprise-grade storage optimized for both VM and container workloads. Module 2 covers storage configuration and performance considerations.

**"How disruptive is the migration process?"**

The Migration Toolkit for Virtualization supports warm migration with minimal downtime. Module 3 walks through the full migration workflow.

**"Do we need to retrain our entire operations team?"**

OpenShift Virtualization uses familiar VM management concepts within the OpenShift console. The learning curve is manageable for teams with existing virtualization experience.
